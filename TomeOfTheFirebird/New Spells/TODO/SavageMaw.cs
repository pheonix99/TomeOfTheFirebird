If you already have a bite attack, your bite deals 2 points of bleed damage on a critical hit. You are considered proficient with this attack.If used as part of a full-attack action, the bite is considered a secondary attack, is made at your full base attack bonus –5, and adds half your Strength modifier to its damage.You can end this spell before its normal duration by making a bestial roar as a swift action.When you do, you can make an Intimidate check to demoralize all foes within a 30-foot radius that can hear the roar.
