//DESCRIPTION

//You cause incredible pressure to build in the target’s head; this spell works only on a creature that has a head and would die from the loss of a head.The spell kills any such target that has 20 hit points or fewer, exploding its head and spreading debris in a 10-foot radius.

//Each creature in the area must succeed at a Reflex saving throw or take 2d6 points of slashing damage from the flying debris.


//A target with more than 20 hit points takes 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 20d6), but can attempt a Fortitude save to take only half damage.If this damage would cause the target to become disabled or dying, the target dies and its head explodes as described above.
